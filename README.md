# Qwirkle

A board game for 2 to 4 players, where one places tiles to score lines. There are six colours and six shapes, so 36 different tiles. Creating a line with all sixshapes or colours yields a Qwirkle, worth six bonus points.

## Components

- An expandable grid
- A bag of tiles
    - 6 colours * 6 shapes * 3 each = 108 tiles
- A hand of tiles per player (always 6 tiles, unless no more are available)
- A scoreboard
